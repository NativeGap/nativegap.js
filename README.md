## Setup

While this package assists you in creating a true cross-platform app, [NativeGap](https://nativegap.com) is still needed to create the actual native code. That's not too big of a deal though, NativeApp can be used entirely for free ([learn more](https://nativegap.com/pricing)) and it has an extensive [documentation](https://nativegap.com/guide).

Getting started with NativeGap:

1. Create a new NativeGap app.
2. Wait until the platforms processed successfully.

That's it!

## Usage

Create a new instance of the `NativeGap` class whenever a page loads:

```javascript
import NativeGap from 'nativegap';
document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', () => const nativegap = new NativeGap );

// Get the users platform
nativegap.platform;
```

### Options

You can pass an options hash when creating a new instance of the `NativeGap` class:

```javascript
let nativegap = new NativeGap({ path: 'nativegap' });
```

#### Global

Global options can be set by passing the options name as a hash key of the options hash.

* `android` Hash of platform specific options for your Android app. Defaults to `{ scale: 1.4 }`.
* `ios` Hash of platform specific options for your iOS app. Defaults to `{ scale: 1 }`.
* `windows` Hash of platform specific options for your Universal Windows Platform (Windows 10) app. Defaults to `{ scale: 1 }`.
* `chrome` Hash of platform specific options for your Chrome extension. Defaults to `{ scale: 1 }`.

#### Platform

Platform options can be set by passing the options name as a hash key of a platform hash.

* `scale` Sets the `font-size` of the HTML page to the product of `16` and the value of this option. Takes a float or an integer.
